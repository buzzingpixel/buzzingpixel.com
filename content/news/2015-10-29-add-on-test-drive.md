I definitely know how it is to wonder if an add-on for ExpressionEngine would fit the needs I have before I buy it. I’ve often found it frustrating that I have not been able to know if the add-on does what I need before shelling out cash for it. And that is why I am always willing to let anyone test drive one of my commercial add-ons before purchasing.

Would you like to test drive one of the BuzzingPixel commercial add-ons before you buy it? No problem! I don't want my paid add-ons hanging around for anyone to download, but if you want to try, I’ll be happy to send you a copy. Just [get in touch with me](/contact) and tell me which add-on you're interested in and I'll send you a copy to evaluate.

And if you have any suggestions or feature requests, be sure to get in touch about those as well. I am currently beta testing some additions to Category Construct that I had a request for that were quite easy to add. The answer to a feature request may not always be yes, but some times it makes sense. And I love hearing from customers!

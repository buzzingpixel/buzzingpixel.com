I’m pleased to announce that as of today, with the release of [Assets 3](https://eeharbor.com/blog/assets-3), [Ansel](/software/ansel-ee) now works with [Assets](https://eeharbor.com/assets) on both ExpressionEngine 2 and ExpressionEngine 3. In the past, many users have asked if Ansel works with or supports Assets. Until today the answer had been no. The reason is Ansel came into being after ExpressionEngine 3 had been released and Assets was not compatible with ExpressionEngine 3. And, while I love Pixel & Tonic and the team over there, the future of their ExpressionEngine add-ons was uncertain. It seemed like a bad use of time to make Ansel compatible with a file-management add-on that may not have a future beyond EE 2. While Ansel has always been compatible with EE 2, EE 3 is the future.

However, with the fine folks over at EEHarbor having acquired Assets and having offered me a pre-release of Assets 3, the time seemed right to work on Ansel's compatibility with Assets.

Starting with Ansel 1.4.0, if Assets is installed, you can choose any of Asset's sources as an upload and/or save destination for an Ansel field type.

As always, if you would like a copy of Ansel to evaluate, don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact)!

Category Construct 2.1.0 has just been released and fixes a couple of bugs:

- Fixed a bug where the direct_parent tag parameter would not accept a pipe delimited list of parent IDs
- Fixed a bug where, under certain circumstances, categories might not be ordered correctly
- Fixed a bug where category image directories would not be parsed

This release also adds a new tag parameter:

- `parent_id_with_children="2|4|6"`

This allows you to get a specific parent ID with the entire rest of the child tree.

Also new in 2.1.0 is the ability to access parent variables from the current child scope like so:

- `{construct:parent_l1:cat_name}`
- `{construct:parent_l2:cat_url_title}`
- `{construct:parent_l3:cat_image}`

As always, 2.1.0 is a free update to existing users and if you have already purchased a copy of Category Construct, you can [download it over at devot:ee][Category Construct Devotee].

Category Construct for ExpressionEngine 3 is here!

ExpressionEngine 3 obviated the Control Panel functionality of Category Construct, so the drag and drop control panel interface of Category Construct has been removed. The primary reason I wrote it was for the template tags anyway. So that's all Category Construct is about now. The template tags are a powerful way to output categories with any level of nesting on your terms. You are in completely control of the markup and the logic is... logical.

The price has also been reduced to $15.00 and it's available for you to buy now!

You can check out the [changelog here](/software/category-construct/changelog).

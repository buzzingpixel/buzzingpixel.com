You know it, and I know it: I have not at all been attending to my add-ons. Not even a little bit. It is long past time I admitted that to myself and to you all.

Ansel being by far my biggest and most sold add-on, I have arranged for it to live on under the care and guidance of Brian Litzinger, a great guy and well respected add-on developer in the ExpressionEngine community. [You can read his announcement about Ansel here](https://boldminded.com/news/boldminded-acquires-ansel-from-buzzingpixel).

Effective immediately, all support, licensing, purchasing, etc. for Ansel will be done through Brian/BoldMinded. All my other add-ons that were for sale will no longer be for sale. All my free add-ons will no longer receive any updates from me.

I'll leave this site up for some time to respond to licensing requests from older versions of Ansel. You'll definitely want to update to Brian's latest version and make sure your licensing is shored up with him because I doubt I'll keep this site online forever â€” certainly not in its current form.

I can say without hesitation that I would not have my career in software engineering if not for ExpressionEngine and the many, many fine people in the community. Though my career has moved away from ExpressionEngine, I would not be leading a software team at [RxAnte](https://www.rxante.com) were it not for my time in the EE community.

I thank each and every one of you from the community who are friends with me, have supported me, bought my add-ons, or otherwise engaged with or helped me along the way and hope to continue to meet up with you, see you online in various places, and more.

You can always reach out to me and drop me a friendly line at tj at buzzingpixel dot com (hey bots, nothing to see here ðŸ˜†).

TJ

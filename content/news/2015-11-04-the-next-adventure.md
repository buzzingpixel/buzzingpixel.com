It has been my great privilege to work at [Caddis Interactive](https://www.caddis.co) for the past two and a half years. It's a fun place to work, we've done some really cool projects, and I have really good friends there. Caddis is where I have done the most growth in my career life. I came on as a mid-level web developer eager to learn and grow. For the past year as I have been a senior developer helping to shape the team, helping developers learn and grow has been nothing short of amazing. The decision to leave the team wasn’t easy because I really believe the team at Caddis is stronger now than it has ever been and I know there are some cool projects in the pipeline and I enjoy working with everyone there.

And Caddis does cool stuff like the [Franklin Developer Lunch and Learn](http://www.meetup.com/franklin-developer-lunch), which I will continue to attend and support because I believe in what they are doing.

But the time has come for me to start a new adventure. I’ll be working on web development through BuzzingPixel full time. While I am already booked for a couple months, if you have any cool projects you would like for me to work on, do get in touch! I’d love to start a conversation with you. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, custom add-on development for EE and/or Craft, and I do know ExpressionEngine like the back of my own hand.

Endings are often beginnings. I will miss the day to day with the team at Caddis, but I look forward to what this new adventure holds!

EllisLab has [released ExpressionEngine 3.1.0] which continues to build upon the solid foundation of 3.0.x. Along with their release of 3.1.0 comes [Construct 2.0.0] which is a major overhaul that matches the visual style of ExpressionEngine 3 and brings several new and awsome features such as the ability to define listing channels (like a blog) for a node, the ability to reorder template preferences so end users will see the order you specify, collapsable tree view, simplified Node editing if routing (creating pages with Nodes) is completely disabled, and more! See [the changelog] for everything.

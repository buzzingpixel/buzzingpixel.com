                    Getting your categories to output in a way that makes sense, particularly with nested category structures, can be a daunting task. But not anymore, thanks to Category Construct! The sole reason for Category Construct's existence is to make your life easier when getting and listing categories!
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-500">
                    Like Construct before it, Category Construct has powerful template tags that put you in charge. You can nest to your heartâ€™s content, you can re-use markup, or you can have entirely different markup per-level. Category Construct makes no assumptions.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-500">
                    And like Construct, the <code>{construct:children}</code> tag ensures your nested child categories will go right where they are supposed to.
